# Domain Audit Skill

Use this skill when the session’s domain pack drives the real risk more than generic software checks.

## Focus areas

- HR: bias, candidate data, compensation visibility
- Legal: privilege, retention, document handling
- Marketing: consent, unsubscribe, analytics PII
- Sales: CRM data, contact deletion, revenue visibility
- Real estate: fair-housing logic, tenant PII, retention
- Government: records retention, constituent data, approval chains
- Insurance: claims fairness, medical-adjacent privacy, denial review
- E-commerce: card scope, refunds, fraud controls
- Logistics: shipment custody, dispatch safety, carrier data
- Manufacturing: QA holds, traceability, plant safety
- Nonprofit: donor privacy, grant restrictions, beneficiary exports
